This MATLAB code runs the PKM model for signal of SEDOM nanosensor prediction in Zhou, et al., in submitting. 
The urinary signal results are demonstrated in the figure after each run. 
All result curves in the paper could be reproducible by changing the appropriate parameters. 
If any discrepancies are observed, please notify the authors.
